Haskell - Aaron Levin
=====================

This is how I work with Haskell projects using Nix.

1. `project-name.nix` contains the nix expression generated by `cabal2nix`
2. `shell.nix` contains dependencies I need to develop my project.
3. `run.nix` contains any run-time dependencies

My typical workflow:

1. `nix-shell` to work on the project.
2. `nix-build run.nix` to build the project and yield an environment with external dependencies (e.g. `redis` in this example)

## Issues

One issue with this workflow is that adding a project to `project-name.cabal` requires me to add that same dependencies to `shell.nix`.
